### Validator staking pool requirements 

After you successfully join the validator set, you must maintain a staking pool with a minimum of 20 Million SUI staked. If, at any point, your staking pool falls below 15 Million SUI, your Validator node is removed from the committee at the next epoch boundary. Sui uses 24-hour epochs.
