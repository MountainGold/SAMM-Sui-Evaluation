title: Transfer to Object
description: On Sui, you can transfer objects to objects in the same way you can transfer objects to addresses.
---

You can transfer objects to an object ID in the same way you transfer objects to an address, using the same functions. This is because Sui does not distinguish between the 32-byte ID of an address and the 32-byte ID of an object (which are guaranteed not to overlap). The transfer to object operation takes advantage of this feature, allowing you to provide an object ID as the address input of a transfer operation. 

Because of the identical ID structure, you can use an object ID for the address field when transferring an object. In fact, all functionality around address-owned objects works the same for objects owned by other objects, you just replace the address with the object ID. 

When you transfer an object to another object, you're basically establishing a form of parent-child authentication relationship. Objects that you have transferred to another object can be received by the (possibly transitive) owner of the parent object. The module that defines the type of the parent (receiving) object also defines the access control for receiving a child object. 

These restrictions for accessing sent child objects are enforced dynamically by providing mutable access to the parent object's `UID` during the execution of the transaction. Because of this, you can transfer objects to and receive them from owned objects, dynamic field objects, wrapped objects, and shared objects. 

One of the benefits of the transfer to object operation is the ability to have a stable ID for an on-chain wallet or account, for example. The transfer of the object doesn't affect its ID, regardless of the state of the object that you send it to. When you transfer an object, all of that object's child objects move with it, and the object's address remains the same whether you transfer it, wrap it, or hold it as a dynamic field.

## Transferring to object

Just like with normal object transfers, you must make sure that the object ID exists that you are transferring the object to. Additionally, make sure that the object that you are transferring to is not immutable. You can't access an object transferred to an immutable object. 

You should know the type of the object you are transferring to because the module that defines that object can:

- Define predicates that can be dynamically checked to access the sent object.
- Lack support for accessing objects that have been sent to it. Future versions of that package might support this functionality, but it's up to the package author to include it.

```rust
// 0xADD is an address
// 0x0B is an object ID
// b and c are objects

// Transfers the object `b` to the address 0xADD
sui::transfer::public_transfer(b, @0xADD);

// Transfers the object `c` to the object with object ID 0x0B
sui::transfer::public_transfer(c, @0x0B);
```

Transferring an object to an object ID results in the same result as if you transferred the object to an address - the object's owner is the 32-byte address or object ID provided. Additionally, because there is no difference in the result of the object transfer, you can use existing RPC methods such as `getOwnedObjects` on the 32-byte ID. If the ID represents an address, then the method returns the objects owned by that address. If the ID is an object ID, then the method returns the objects the object ID owns (transferred objects).

```rust
// Get the objects owned by the address 0xADD. Returns `b`.
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "suix_getOwnedObjects",
  "params": [
    "0xADD"
  ]
}

// Get the objects owned by the object with object ID 0x0B. Returns `c`
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "suix_getOwnedObjects",
  "params": [
    "0x0B"
  ]
}
```

## Receiving objects

After an object `c` has been sent to another object `p`, `p` must then receive `c` to do anything with it. To receive the object `c`, a  `Receiving(o: ObjectRef)` argument type for programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) is used that takes an object reference containing the to-be-received object's `ObjectID`, `Version`, and `Digest` (just as owned object arguments for PTBs do). However, `Receiving` PTB arguments are not passed as an owned value or mutable reference within the transaction. 

To explain further, look at the core of the receiving interface in Move, which is defined in the `sui::transfer` module in the Sui framework:

```rust
module sui::transfer {
    /// Represents the ability to receive an object of type `T`. Cannot be stored.
    struct Receiving<phantom T: key> has drop { ... }
    
    /// Given mutable (i.e., locked) access to the `parent` and a `Receiving`
    /// object referencing an object owned by `parent` use the `Receiving` ticket
    /// and return the corresponding object.
    /// NB: &mut UID here allows the defining module of the parent type to
    /// define custom access/permission policies around receiving objects sent
    /// to objects of a type that it defines. You can see this more in the examples.
    public native fun receive<T: key>(parent: &mut UID, object: Receiving<T>): T;
...
}
```

Each Receiving argument referring to a sent object of type `T` in a PTB results in exactly one argument with a Move type of `sui::transfer::Receiving<T>`. You can then use this argument to receive the sent object of type `T` with the `sui::transfer::receive` function.

When you call the `sui::transfer::receive` function, you must pass a mutable reference to the parent object's `UID`. You can't get a mutable reference to the `UID` of an object, though, unless the defining module of the object exposes it. Consequently, the module that defines the type of the parent object that is receiving the child object defines access control policies and other restrictions on receiving objects that are sent to it. See the [authorization example](#receive-shared-example) for a demonstration of this pattern. The fact that the passed-in `UID` actually owns the object referenced by the `Receiving` parameter is dynamically checked and enforced. This allows access to objects that have been sent to, for example, dynamic fields where the ownership chain can only be established dynamically.

Because `sui::transfer::Receiving` has only the `drop` ability, the existence of a `Receiving<T>` argument represents the ability, but not the obligation to receive the object of type `T` specified by the object reference in the PTB `Receiving` argument during that transaction. You can use some, none, or all `Receiving` arguments in a PTB without issue. Any object that corresponds to a `Receiving` argument remains untouched (in particular, its object reference remain the same) unless it is received.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate receiving previously sent objects.

### Receiving objects from shared objects {#receive-shared-example}

Generally, if you want to allow receiving sent objects from shared objects that are defined in the module, add dynamic authorization checks; otherwise, anyone could receive sent objects. In this example a shared object `SharedObject` holds a counter that anyone can increment, but only the address `0xB0B` can receive objects from the shared object.

```rust
module examples::shared_object_auth {
    use sui::transfer::{Self, Receiving};
    use sui::object;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
    const EAccessDenied: u64 = 0;
    const AuthorizedReceiverAddr: address = @0xB0B;

    struct SharedObject has key {
        id: object::UID,
        counter: u64,
    }

    public fun create(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let s = SharedObject { id: object::new(ctx), };
        transfer::share_object(s);
    }
    
    /// Anyone can increment the counter in the shared object.
    public fun increment(obj: &mut SharedObject) {
        obj.counter = obj.counter + 1;
    }
   
    /// Objects can only be received from the `SharedObject` by the 
    /// `AuthorizedReceiverAddr` otherwise the transaction aborts.
    public fun receive_object<T: key>(obj: &mut SharedObject, sent: Receiving<T>): T {
        assert!(tx_context::sender(ctx) == AuthorizedReceiverAddr, EAccessDenied);
        transfer::receive(&mut obj.id, sent)
    }
}
```

### Receiving objects and adding them as dynamic fields

This example defines a basic account-type model where an `Account` object holds its coin balances in different dynamic fields. This `Account` is also transferable to a different address or object.

Importantly, the address that coins are to be sent with this `Account` object remains the same regardless of whether the `Account` object is transferred, wrapped (for example, in an escrow account), or moved into a dynamic field. In particular, there is a stable ID for a given `Account` object across the object's lifecycle, regardless of any ownership changes.

```rust
module examples::account {
    use sui::transfer::{Self, Receiving};
    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};
    use sui::object;
    use sui::dynamic_field as df;
    use sui::tx_context::TxContext;

    const EBalanceDONE: u64 = 1;

    /// Account object that `Coin`s can be sent to. Balances of different types
    /// are held as dynamic fields indexed by the `Coin` type's `type_name`.
    struct Account has key {
        id: object::UID,
    }

    /// Dynamic field key representing a balance of a particular coin type.
    struct AccountBalance<phantom T> has copy, drop, store { }

    /// This function will receive a coin sent to the `Account` object and then
    /// join it to the balance for each coin type.
    /// Dynamic fields are used to index the balances by their coin type.
    public fun accept_payment<T>(account: &mut Account, sent: Receiving<Coin<T>>) {
        // Receive the coin that was sent to the `account` object
        let coin = transfer::receive(&mut account.id, sent);
        let account_balance_type = AccountBalance<T>{};
        let account_uid = &mut account.id;

        // Check if a balance of that coin type already exists.
        // If it does then merge the coin we just received into it,
        // otherwise create new balance.
        if (df::exists_(account_uid, account_balance_type)) {
            let balance: &mut Coin<T> = df::borrow_mut(account_uid, account_balance_type);
            coin::join(balance, coin);
        } else {
            df::add(account_uid, account_balance_type, coin);
        }
    }

    /// Withdraw `amount` of coins of type `T` from `account`.
    public fun withdraw<T>(account: &mut Account, amount: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext): Coin<T> {
        let account_balance_type = AccountBalance<T>{};
        let account_uid = &mut account.id;
        // Make sure what we are withdrawing exists
        assert!(df::exists_(account_uid, account_balance_type), EBalanceDONE);
        let balance: &mut Coin<T> = df::borrow_mut(account_uid, account_balance_type);
        coin::split(balance, amount, ctx)
    }

    /// Can transfer this account to a different address
    /// (e.g., to an object or address). 
    public fun transfer_account(account: Account, to: address, _ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        // Perform some authorization checks here and if they pass then transfer the account
        // ...
        transfer::transfer(account, to);
    }
}
```
